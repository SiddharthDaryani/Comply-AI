Social Media Compliance Rulebook - Version 2.1
**Policy Excerpt 1: Brand Tone and Voice** 
All social media posts must maintain a professional, positive, and forward-looking tone. Sarcasm, negativity, or direct criticism of competitors is strictly prohibited. Avoid using excessive exclamation marks or all-caps text, as this can be perceived as shouting. 
**Policy Excerpt 2: Unverified Claims**
 Marketing drafts must not contain any hyperbolic, unverified, or misleading claims, especially regarding product performance, health benefits, or financial returns. Statements must be supported by verifiable internal data, which must be referenced internally. 
**Policy Excerpt 3: Confidential Information** 
Never, under any circumstances, share internal financial data, unannounced product launch dates, or employee personal information. This includes "teasers" that reveal specific, non-public details. Posts must be about generally available, approved information. 
**Policy Excerpt 4: Appropriate Imagery** 
All images and videos must be high-resolution and free of third-party copyrighted material unless express written permission is secured. Use only approved stock photography or internally created graphics. No low-quality memes are allowed on the official brand channels. 
**Policy Excerpt 5: Regulatory Language (Legal)**
All promotional posts related to sales or discounts must include the term "Terms and Conditions Apply" and a link to the full legal disclaimer page in the caption. This is a mandatory requirement for all time-sensitive offers.
